## Introduction

This is a booking system for a Recording Studio.
It contains of four (4) pages, a register/login option and a calender.
A Superuser is also created for full access.

### Site Goals

- The purpose of the booking system is to simplify the actual booking.

- To make it easy for musicians to record both small ideas up to an entire album.

### Second page

- After the user have either registered a new user, or logged in by an already existing user, it loads the second page.
- It gives you a welcome message and a button that says "Book".
- The navbar switches from "Login" to "Logout" when a valid user is logged in.
- Pressing the button takes the user to the third page.

## Structure

### Logical Flow

- I have created a flowchart of the structure for this app. Following flow is how the program works right now. See section of [Features left to Implement](#features-left-to-implement) for the expected final version.

### Features Left to Implement

- This is a flowchart of the expected final version.

![flowchart_expected](/static/assets/img/exp_flowchart.png)

- Features to implement:

### Database design

## Technologies

- Python - Python was the main language to build this app.
- Bootstrap 5 was used for styling.
- Django was used as the framework for the entire project.
- Allauth was used to create the login-authorization
- Datepicker and Crispy forms was used to create the calender.
- GitHub - source code is hosted on GitHub.
- CodeAnywhere was used to develop this project.

## Testing

### Functional Testing

### Bugs and Fixes
- CSS is not loading properly
- For further info about bugs, check the Functional Testing.

## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using the CodeAnywhere editor and pushed to github to the remote repository "??".

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

`git add .` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.
`git commit -m "commit message"¬ù` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.
`git push` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.


### Heroku Deployment

## Credits
* Credits to Tutor Support at Code Institute for guiding and assisting me when errors occurs, and helping me find a way forward.
  

### Code
* I used Code Institutes walkthrough project as tutorial for setting everything up and get the connection to my Worksheet, and also for steps to deploy my program to Heroku.
* For Allauth I used the lesson by Matt in "I Think therefore I blog"
* For the datepicker I used this tutorial at webpedia: https://webpedia.net/how-to-use-datepicker-in-django


#### Notes
- Secret data has been deployed to Github due to a mistake by me writing the URL in settings. For the deployed version this has been corrected, but still some commits has the sensitive information though.
